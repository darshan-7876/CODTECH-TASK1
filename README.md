Project Name: House Price Predictor GUI

Project Description: This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) program that allows users to input various features of a house, such as lot area, total basement square feet, overall quality, pool area, and neighborhood, and predicts the sale price of the house based on a linear regression model.

Features:

User-friendly interface for inputting house features
Predicts sale price of house based on input features
Displays predicted price in a clear and concise format
Technologies Used:

Python 3.8
Tkinter 8.6 (for GUI)
Files:

house_price_predictor_gui.py: The Python script that implements the GUI and prediction logic
README.md: This file
How to Run:

Install Python 3.8 and Tkinter 8.6 if not already installed
Run the house_price_predictor_gui.py script using Python (e.g. python house_price_predictor_gui.py)
Follow the prompts to input house features and click the "Predict Price" button to see the predicted sale price
Note: This program assumes that the linear regression model has already been trained and the coefficients are hardcoded in the predict_price method. In a real-world scenario, the model would be trained using a dataset and the coefficients would be calculated dynamically.
